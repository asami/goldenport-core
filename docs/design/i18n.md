# I18n Message Design

## Intent

The core library keeps message localization unresolved to avoid premature
coupling to runtime context. This preserves composability across CLI, logs,
and integration layers.

## ROOT Locale as Semantic Truth

The ROOT locale is treated as the canonical, language-neutral representation
of a message. It provides a stable anchor that does not depend on user
preferences or environment.

## Deferred Resolution

Localized selection is intentionally delayed until a layer has the necessary
context (user settings, environment, or UI constraints). The core library
only provides deterministic selection for system-facing display.

## Performance Considerations

Resolving messages at the edge avoids repeated locale selection inside core
structures and keeps core data lightweight.

## Relationship to MessageResource

MessageResource is expected to supply localized entries and is responsible
for external storage or lookup. I18nMessage remains a pure value carrier.

## Roles and Separation

- I18nString: short, localized labels or titles
- I18nMessage: system-facing messages and summaries
- I18nTemplate: parameterized message construction

Historical background and rationale are documented in `docs/notes/i18n-history.md`.
