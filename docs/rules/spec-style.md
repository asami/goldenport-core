Spec Style Rules
==================================

status=published
published_at=2025-12-26

# PURPOSE
This document defines the standard style for writing specifications
in SimpleModeling.

The goal is to ensure that specifications are:
- Readable as documents
- Executable as tests
- Authoritative as design artifacts

These rules apply to **Working Specifications**.

---

# CORE PRINCIPLE

A specification in SimpleModeling is not a test of execution,
but a **description of semantic interpretation**.

Executable Specifications prioritize readability as normative documents over
authoring flexibility.

Specifications define *what a model means*,
not *what a system does at runtime*.

---

# STRUCTURE

Specifications MUST be written using:

- `AnyWordSpec` (default)
- `Matchers`
- `GivenWhenThen`

`AnyFreeSpec` MAY be used only when the semantic structure cannot be adequately
expressed within the structural constraints of `AnyWordSpec`.

This combination provides:
- Natural-language structure
- Clear assertions
- Executable specification logging

---

# SPEC AS TABLE OF CONTENTS

In SimpleModeling, specification files serve as **specification chapters**, organizing the semantic interpretation domain into a structured, living document.

- The spec file itself represents a chapter that covers a broad semantic responsibility or model component.
- Top-level `should` blocks define **sections** describing public responsibilities or contracts of the model or system.
- Nested `when` / `should` blocks act as **subsections**, organizing input dimensions such as positional arguments, switches, or properties that affect interpretation.
- `in` blocks are the smallest executable specification units, representing individual semantic assertions or acceptance/rejection rules.

This hierarchy reflects the semantic interpretation structure, emphasizing clarity and maintainability in executable specifications.

## HIERARCHY RULES

1. A specification file corresponds to a **specification chapter** capturing a cohesive semantic domain.
2. The first-level structure (`should` blocks) defines the **public API or semantic responsibility** of the model.
3. The second-level structure (`when` / nested `should`) organizes **input or interaction dimensions** affecting interpretation.
4. The third-level structure (`in` blocks) specifies **acceptance or rejection rules**, the executable semantic contracts.

### Example ProtocolEngine Spec TOC

```
ProtocolEngineSpec
├─ should "handle basic protocol messages"
│  ├─ when "receiving a connect message"
│  │  ├─ should "accept valid connection requests"
│  │  └─ should "reject invalid connection requests"
│  └─ when "receiving a disconnect message"
│     └─ should "close the connection gracefully"
└─ should "manage session state"
   ├─ when "session is active"
   │  └─ should "maintain correct session data"
   └─ when "session expires"
      └─ should "clean up resources"
```

This structured approach ensures that specifications remain **semantic interpretations**, not runtime tests, and serve as **living documentation** that clearly communicates model meaning and responsibilities.

The fixed grammatical roles of `should` / `when` / `in` in `AnyWordSpec` are
intentionally leveraged to make specification structure immediately obvious
to readers (human or AI). Structural freedom should not be introduced unless
it is required to express semantic complexity.

# TWO KINDS OF SPECIFICATIONS

SimpleModeling recognizes two distinct styles of specifications, each answering different semantic questions and serving complementary purposes. These **MUST NOT** be mixed within the same specification file. Both styles must adhere to the Spec-as-TOC hierarchy rules and remain executable semantic interpretations.

## INTERFACE-DRIVEN (BOTTOM-UP) SPECIFICATIONS

**Purpose:**  
To specify the semantic contracts of individual model components or interfaces, defining their meaning in isolation and how they interpret inputs.

**Starting Point:**  
A single model interface, service, or operation under test.

**What is Specified:**  
The detailed semantic interpretation rules of the interface’s inputs, outputs, and failure modes.

**Typical Subjects:**  
- `ProtocolEngine`  
- `Operation`  
- `Service`  

**Given / When / Then Interpretation:**  
- **Given:** Model definitions, interface setup, and preconditions without execution or side effects.  
- **When:** Invocation of the interface or operation semantics (e.g., method calls).  
- **Then:** Assertions on the semantic result, including success or failure interpretations.

**Hierarchy Usage:**  
- Top-level `should` blocks define major interface responsibilities or contracts.  
- Nested `when` / `should` blocks organize input variations or parameter dimensions.  
- `in` blocks specify acceptance or rejection rules for particular semantic cases.

**Example Skeleton:**

```scala
class OperationSpec extends AnyWordSpec with GivenWhenThen {
  "Operation" should {
    "accept valid parameters" when {
      "given a positive integer" should {
        "return success" in {
          given("an operation with positive integer input")
          when("the operation is interpreted")
          then("the result is a successful semantic object")
        }
      }
      "given a negative integer" should {
        "reject the input" in {
          given("an operation with negative integer input")
          when("the operation is interpreted")
          then("the result is a failure semantic object")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## USECASE-DRIVEN (TOP-DOWN) SPECIFICATIONS

**Purpose:**  
To specify the semantic interpretation of complete use cases or scenarios, describing how multiple model components collaborate to fulfill a business or domain-level intention.

**Starting Point:**  
A high-level use case or scenario representing a user or system goal.

**What is Specified:**  
The overall semantic flow, including interaction sequences, input conditions, and expected outcomes.

**Typical Subjects:**  
- `Usecase`  
- `Workflow`  
- `Scenario`  

**Given / When / Then Interpretation:**  
- **Given:** Contextual setup describing the scenario environment and preconditions.  
- **When:** The triggering event or semantic request initiating the use case interpretation.  
- **Then:** Assertions on the final semantic state or outcome of the use case interpretation.

**Hierarchy Usage:**  
- Top-level `should` blocks define major use case responsibilities or goals.  
- Nested `when` / `should` blocks organize scenario variants or system states.  
- `in` blocks specify semantic acceptance or rejection criteria for each scenario step or outcome.

**Example Skeleton:**

```scala
class UsecaseSpec extends AnyWordSpec with GivenWhenThen {
  "Usecase" should {
    "process a valid request" when {
      "the user is authenticated" should {
        "complete successfully" in {
          given("a logged-in user and a valid request")
          when("the use case is executed")
          then("the semantic interpretation succeeds")
        }
      }
      "the user is not authenticated" should {
        "reject the request" in {
          given("an unauthenticated user and a valid request")
          when("the use case is executed")
          then("the semantic interpretation fails")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## COMPARISON TABLE

| Aspect               | Interface-Driven (Bottom-Up)               | Usecase-Driven (Top-Down)                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Specify semantics of individual interfaces | Specify semantics of complete use cases     |
| **Viewpoint**        | Component-level, isolated interface semantics | Scenario-level, holistic domain semantics    |
| **Granularity**      | Fine-grained, detailed input/output rules  | Coarse-grained, end-to-end semantic flows   |
| **Stability**        | More stable, tied to interface contracts   | More volatile, reflecting evolving use cases|
| **Naming**           | Named after interfaces or operations        | Named after use cases or scenarios           |

---

Both kinds of specifications are **executable semantic interpretations** that answer different questions about the model meaning. They provide complementary perspectives and together ensure comprehensive semantic documentation.

---

# CML AND SCENARIO SPEC OPERATIONS

## ROLE OF CML

CML (Canonical Modeling Language) serves as the canonical source of truth for usecases and their slices. It defines the authoritative semantic structure and decomposition of usecases that Scenario Specifications must align with.

## CANONICAL SCENARIO SPECS (CML-BASED)

Canonical Scenario Specifications are named following the rule `<Usecase><Slice>ScenarioSpec`. Each ScenarioSpec must match the slice name exactly as defined in CML. The presence of a matching ScenarioSpec is required to consider the slice fully specified. Missing ScenarioSpecs indicate incomplete semantic documentation and must be addressed to maintain authoritative interpretation.

## PROVISIONAL SCENARIO SPECS (BOTTOM-UP)

Provisional Scenario Specifications are exploratory or hypothesis-driven specifications created to investigate semantic interpretations or propose new slices. They are explicitly marked either by the `ProvisionalScenarioSpec` suffix or by placement within a `provisional` subpackage. These specs are non-authoritative and serve as living drafts until promoted or discarded.

## PROMOTION AND LIFECYCLE

Promotion from provisional to canonical status occurs when a provisional ScenarioSpec is reviewed, accepted, and its semantics are incorporated into the CML slice definition. The lifecycle steps are:

- Provisional ScenarioSpec is created for exploration.
- Upon approval, the corresponding CML slice is defined or updated.
- A canonical ScenarioSpec named `<Usecase><Slice>ScenarioSpec` is created or updated to match CML.
- The provisional ScenarioSpec is deleted or archived if rejected.

This process ensures that canonical Scenario Specifications remain the authoritative semantic interpretations aligned with the CML model.

```
ProvisionalScenarioSpec
        ↓ promote
   CML Slice Definition
        ↓ generate/update
 Canonical ScenarioSpec
        ↓ delete if rejected
```

# GIVEN / WHEN / THEN SEMANTICS

The `GivenWhenThen` DSL is mandatory for top-level behavior descriptions.

Each clause has a **SimpleModeling-specific meaning**:

## GIVEN
Describes:
- Model definitions
- Service / operation specifications
- Preconditions for interpretation

`given` MUST NOT:
- Perform execution
- Contain side effects
- Depend on runtime state

---

## WHEN
Describes:
- A semantic request
- Interpretation invocation (e.g. `makeRequest`)

`when` MUST:
- Express *meaningful intent*
- Avoid execution semantics

---

## THEN
Describes:
- The semantic result
- The resolved model object
- Success or failure of interpretation

`then` MUST:
- Assert on model structure or type
- Treat failure as a valid specification outcome

`then` MUST NOT:
- Execute operations
- Perform IO
- Validate runtime behavior

---

# LOGGING AND OUTPUT

The text passed to `given`, `when`, and `then` MUST be written
as human-readable specification sentences.

These sentences are considered part of the specification itself,
since they appear in test execution output.

---

# FAILURE AS SPECIFICATION

Failure cases are first-class specifications.

Specifications SHOULD explicitly define:
- Missing services
- Unknown operations
- Invalid parameter interpretations

A failure result is a **valid semantic outcome**.

---

# STYLE RULES

## MUST
- Use `GivenWhenThen`
- Use explicit `given / when / then` blocks
- Keep one semantic contract per test case
- Assert only on semantic results

## SHOULD
- Keep setup inline within `given`
- Use descriptive sentences in DSL calls
- Treat specs as documentation first

## MUST NOT
- Use `beforeEach` for hidden setup
- Test execution or side effects
- Mix runtime concerns into specifications

---

## PACKAGE PLACEMENT RULE

Executable Specifications **MUST** be placed in the same package as the production code they specify.

This rule treats specifications as first-class semantic definitions rather than auxiliary test artifacts.

### RATIONALE

- Co-locating specs with production code makes the semantic responsibility explicit.
- Readers (human or AI) can discover authoritative behavior by navigating the package structure alone.
- This avoids artificial separation such as `*.spec` packages that obscure ownership and intent.

### EXAMPLES

```scala
// Production code
package org.goldenport.protocol.handler.projection

class McpGetManifestProjection { ... }
```

```scala
// Executable Specification
package org.goldenport.protocol.handler.projection

class McpGetManifestProjectionSpec
  extends AnyWordSpec
     with Matchers
     with GivenWhenThen {
  ...
}
```

Specifications placed in `*.spec` or parallel test-only packages are considered **legacy layout** and SHOULD be migrated when touched.

---

# EXAMPLES

Typical Working Specifications include:
- `CliEngineSpec`
- `CliLogicSpec`
- `OperationDefinitionSpec`

These specs define the authoritative behavior
of the model interpretation layer.

---


# MARKDOWN FOR AI-ASSISTED DOCUMENTATION

Program-internal documents intended for AI-assisted development, design reasoning, semantic analysis, or MCP/RAG interaction **MUST** be written in Markdown.

## RATIONALE

Markdown provides a structured, widely supported, and diffable format that is compatible with AI language models, semantic tooling, and collaborative workflows. Its plain-text nature enables effective version control, easy review, and reliable parsing for automated or AI-assisted processes.

## SCOPE

This rule applies to internal documents such as specifications, rules, design notes, TODO lists, and any artifact intended for AI-assisted development, semantic analysis, or MCP/RAG workflows.  
It **explicitly excludes** public-facing SmartDox documents, which are governed by separate authoring and publication rules.

## FRONT MATTER

YAML Front Matter **MAY** be used for document metadata.  
Front Matter is ignored by Markdown renderers and does not affect document semantics.

# NOTES

This style intentionally differs from traditional BDD.
While the structure is similar, the intent is semantic,
not behavioral or execution-oriented.
