ESSION CONTEXT (ALWAYS ON):

- Follow chappie-session.md rules.
- Always present options with explicit numbering.
- Any copy-pasteable content MUST be inside ````text.
- Do NOT mark work as complete unless the program runs.
- Do NOT declare work "out of scope".
- The demo goal is to converge on final architecture, not quick hacks.

Acknowledge silently and continue.
