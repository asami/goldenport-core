# I18n Message

## Role

`I18nMessage` is a localized message container used in core data structures.
It is a library-level value and does not perform UI rendering.

## displayMessage

`displayMessage` is defined as a deterministic, system-facing string.
It is suitable for CLI output, logs, and exception summaries.

Locale resolution order is fixed and must be applied exactly as follows:

1. ROOT locale (language-neutral / C)
2. English
3. Japanese
4. stored entry order (first available)

If no entries are available, `displayMessage` must return an empty string.

## Scope

`displayMessage` is not a UI-facing renderer.
UI-specific formatting, user preferences, and rich localization are out of scope.

Design rationale is documented in docs/design/i18n.md
