# i18n Historical Context
This document preserves the historical background, rationale, and design context
for the i18n model. It is non-normative and complements the normative design
defined in `docs/design/i18n.md`.

This structure follows lessons from Goldenport, where decoupling message
resolution from execution context simplified reuse across multiple adapters.
