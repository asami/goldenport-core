Journal — 2026 / 01
------------------

This directory contains **journal documents** created during
development and design exploration in January 2026.

Files here are **working notes**, not finalized specifications
or design documents.

Topics are **not limited** to a single domain.
The current concentration of error-related files reflects
ongoing work at that time, not a directory constraint.

## Purpose of This Directory

This directory is used to:

- Record exploratory design thinking
- Fix semantic decisions temporarily
- Compare alternative models
- Preserve context before consolidation or promotion

All files here are **mutable and disposable**.

## Current Major Topic (as of this snapshot)

The dominant topic in this directory is currently:

- **Phase 2.9 — Error Model Consolidation**

This includes work on:

- Consequence / Conclusion based error propagation
- Observation / Interpretation / Disposition separation
- Error taxonomy and usage examples
- Legacy Fault model alignment

This focus may change over time.

## Navigation Guide (Current Files)

### error-model-phase-2.9.md

Primary integration journal for **Phase 2.9 error model work**.

- Consolidated understanding
- Agreed structure and semantics
- Open questions and next steps

### conclusion-model.md

Exploration of **Conclusion as a value object**.

### error-information-model.md

Early material on **error-related information axes**.

### error-taxonomy.md / error-taxonomy-0123.md

### phase-2.9-error-usecases.md

## Important Notes

- Files in this directory are **journals**
- Temporary inconsistencies are acceptable
- Breaking changes are allowed
- Do not treat these files as authoritative design

## Promotion Policy

Once a topic stabilizes:

- Relevant content may be promoted to:
  - design documents
  - specification documents
- Journal files may be archived or removed

Until promotion, **clarity of thought has priority over structure**.

## Status

- Directory role: exploratory journal
- Content scope: unrestricted
- Stability: provisional
